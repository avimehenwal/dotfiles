# How did APIs develop in the history of programming?
1948    sub routine library, Goldstine von Neumann

# Current APIs types?
- RPC remote procedure calls
- REST HTTP based APIs, web APIs
- communicate between software and hardware components

# Oldest APIs
- CPU ISA instruction set architecture operations
- Fortran Math functions
- UNIX system calls, kernel and linux apis

# Use Cases
- interportable, reusable softwares

# Resources
- [History of the API](https://youtu.be/LzMp6uQbmns)

## Standards for developing APIs
1. REST-based APIs - How server should expose data to the client, for efficiency!
2. GraphQL based APIs - declerative data fetching

# Methods that APIs uses to talk to each other? Integration Patterns
1. Orchestration microservices
2. Choregraphed microservices

## GraphQL concepts
- SDL schema definition language
- query
- mutations, changind data POST on server
- subscriptions
- is only a specification
