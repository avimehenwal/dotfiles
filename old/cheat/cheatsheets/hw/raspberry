? How to build raspberry pi os from scratch using yocto?

# connect raspberry pi to internet router and attach hard drives
configure port Forwarding on your router
Configure access security
    /etc/hosts.allow
    /etc/hosts.deny    sshd: ALL EXCEPT 10.2.2.196

# Datasheet
    [ARM Cortex A72 by Broadcom used in raspberry pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_Cortex-A72)

# Pi Home Server
1. set static IP, predictable IP address
2. enable port forwarding on router
3. Install web server on Pi
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install snapd
        sudo reboot
        sudo snap install caddy --edge
