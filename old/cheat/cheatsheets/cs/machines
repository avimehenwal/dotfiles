Everything is a machine, even a software

# Machine
mechanical energy (force, pressure, movement, direction)

# Programming languages are stack based machines
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)

# Backtracking - DFS (using stacks) | similar to Branch & Bound (BFS)
8-queen problem , critial solution set *, 
solution set/tree state space tree -  tree of all possible solutions, respecting CONSTRAINTS
Problem solving strategy using Brute Force
that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate ("backtracks")
as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution

The only thing computers are good at is Enumeration and the speed at which they can enumerate

# Dynamic Programming
Fibinacchi Series solution by recursion
simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems in a RECURSIVE manner.

Some Programming languages are implemented using a data structure called StackFrame
just an abstraction over Memory
Registers - special memory locations, Eg: stackPointer
all instructions on STACK
your own ISA in any programming language of your choice
