# Reflection
Feature, ability of a programming language to modify/query/introspect itself @runtime
usually implemented using Metaprogramming

# Why use reflection and metaprogramming? Advantages
+ Dynamic Program Analysis
+ Handle new situations without recompilation
+ self modifying code

+----------+  computation   +--------------+
| @runtime | -------------> | @compiletime |
+----------+                +--------------+

# MetaProgramming
technique to read/transform/write-new/consume other programs from current program
+ Mocking and testing
js:   Function, eval()
Eg1  assign new Function (native Function Object) definitions @runtime to existing functions
Eg2  shell scripting writing another shell script, changing its permissions to executable and then executing it
echo "[@runtime] -- computation --> [@compiletime]" | graph-easy
