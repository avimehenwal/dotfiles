> How to be a CSS GOD!

_C_ Cascading _S_ Styled _S_ Sheets

- Programming Language
- CSS Selectors `styles.css`
- [Css selectors MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors)
- [css selectors specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html%23id-selectors)
- Use Variables to be consistent throughout the whole design

```css
<css Selector > {
  style-property: style-value;
}
```

- Difference b/w _ID_ and _class_
  - Specificity
- **PseudoSelectory** widely used in transitions and animations
  - `selector:pseudoselector`, `h2:hover`, `li:first-child`, `li:nth-child(2)`
  - Adjust link, visited colors `#google-links:visited`
  - `:hover` Behaviour, feedback

| Selectors | Description        |
| :-------: | ------------------ |
|     +     | Adjascent Selector |

- Use class when REUSING CSS properties
- Use other complicated selectors under SPecificity conditions only

  - Font Manipulation | websites generally uses 2 fonts, 1 headings and 2nd for main text
    - font-weight 100 to 800 usually, already set for the specific font

## The Box Model

Padding | Internal space
Margin | External Space

- `display: none` very popular with games, making sites interactive

## CSS Positions

static | How markup is written
relative | change top, left, right, bottom relative to where it is supposed to be
absolute | completely removes the element from DOM, tlbr works in conjunction with relative
fixed | fixed based on entire HTML document, not affected by parent
sticky | relative + fixed

### Display Property

block full line length
inline as small space as possible, NO height and width
inline-block can have height and width

## FlexBox

> One Dimensional

- Arrange elements on page, different than BoxModel.
- Has a _Container_ and _child_ elements
- Flex-direction

## Grid System

> Two Dimensional

- functionally same like Flexbox BUT with more (magnitude) of options
- Fancy text with title and subheading and price over an image
- [Responsive design using CSS grids](https://youtu.be/68O6eOGAGqA)

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  .container {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
    grid-template-rows: 0.4fr, 0.4fr, 2.2fr, 1.2fr, 1.2fr, 1fr;
    grid-template-areas:
      "nav"
      "sidebar"
      "menu"
      "content 1/2/3"
      "footer";
  }
}
```

## Transitions

Transition gracefully from one property to another.

- Changing background on hover
- translate
- SkewX/Y
- rotate()

## Browser Specific CSS

Prefix, use them seperately, cant chain them in one.

Chrome `-webkit-`
Mozilla `-moz-`
Opera `-o-`

## CSS Animations

Are Keyframes driven

- Structure vs Skin

## CSS Preprocessor
