# What is Elm
+ FP, replacement for HTML/JS/CSS
+ If it compiles, it runs
- integration with other JS libraries, NO interop

# difference with closurescript
. syntax is different
. clojurescript only for JS, eml for entire frontend stack
- no IO in go blocks, are DB reads/writes considered as IO?
+ js + java platform reach
+ stability, JVM optimization and rhobustnes
