# What kind of app you are building?
Interactive webapp - Full duplex 2-way communiaction
recieve i/ps from multiple sources (not only from UI) and cordinate on client reasonably
react to problems ~1000 events per second, BUT updates the UI twice per second
FP approach vs OO approach

# Problems/ Issues
How to we draw all the animation? How do we control and cordinate various components?
Browse janks when there are too many animations and async fetching going on? How to solve that?
Where all problems in browser code are? Rendering and Service, keep them seperate. but how?
-> cljs no direct function calls, put messages on queues

# Information Model
organize and store data, tree- nested maps
state transition model    Atom: Reference type to dereference a immutable value. Can add watcher to Atom with old and new values
AppEngine                 wiring up the functions, pipelines will run the code
Change Report             store messages and replay them later
WebWorker                 decide Ahead of time what needs to be run on web-worker

# How does using the clojure instead of JS actually make the project easy?
Clojure conceptes of FP, immutability, persistant DS, channels queues, app engines

# How can we avoid mutable state, mutating states and other side-effects?
Minimize         keep of turns by a variable name, OR function to count unfilled grids and determine whos turn based on count
                 persistant DS instead of mutate-in-place
                 make and pass lambdas around map reduce transducers tied to a context higher order functions,
                 concentrate + defer      jQuery vs react defer, redux pattern older in clojure re-frame

# How to many a library like aws-sdk? Multiple language frontends
Data Structures are the purest forms for Information
Service based JSON Interfacs (data) implemented in multiple languages. Code sharing?

# How to convert a OO code to FP paradigm? Solving Problems the Clojure Way - Rafal Dittwald
Where do I have
- states? values that change?
- mutations that change these values?
- side-effects, other code that triggers OTHER code?

# What is DDP Data Driven Programming?
> Its better to have 100 functions operate on 1 data structure than 10 functions on 10 data structures
Data structures are the purest form of information, mutations over time through pure functions
Data-first program, transformation Pipelines, dont have types, structs
Side Effects      talk to DB, REST calls, sending emails, read/write file system. Lets just do our best to avoid it
transparency is about understanding, understanding is about predictions, Moser's circle problem
if predictions are wrong we dont understand, sometimes right predictions may be lucky

# What makes code transparent, predictions?
Constraints like static types, immutability, pure functions
RegEx are non turing complete, Non-deterministic automata, RE2/J halt regex in resonable amount of time
with great power comes great unpredictability
Tim BErners-Lee - rule of least power, DSL
Maps can be used as functions in clojure
avoid loops and recursion is the easiest way to avoid turing completness
inheritance trees for clojure keywords along with namespaces, multiple inheritance

# How to compile to JS? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27109510/how-to-compile-clojurescript-to-javascript
lein new mies hello-world
cd hello-world

# How to add dependency? to manipulate DOM via google closure library?
(ns so-doc.events
  (:require
   [goog.dom :as dom]
   [goog.events :as events]))

(defn handle-click [event] (js/alert "button pressed"))
(events/listen (dom/getElement "button") (.-CLICK events/EventType) handle-click )

# What is ^ carat sign in cljs?
^ is "the meta character" it tells the reader to add the symbol starting with ^ as metadata to the next symbol
(provided it is something that implements IMetas)
