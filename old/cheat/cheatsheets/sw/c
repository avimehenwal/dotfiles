1969-1973 	Dennis Ritchie (Bell Labs) 	Was an enhancement of Ken Thompson's B language.
ANSI C      standardized version of C, C89, C90
1984        GNU Project in 1984 to build a UNIX-like open source software system
2000        LLVM was originated from the research by Chris Lattner on UUIC 

## Clang vs gcc
1. Visual C++
2. GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)                compiler developed by GNU
3. Clang/Low Level Virtual Machine (LLVM)       series of toolchains and compiler tools
Clang is designed to provide a frontend compiler that can replace GCC

are three mainstream C/C++ compilers in the industry

## Why multiple implementations for the same language?
Earlier each company had their own implementation, IBM, Motorolla, Sun
No Mono-cultures
clang and llvm are more or less written from scratch

## Core Concepts
+ variables and memory allocations, references
+ static types in C, arrays
+ Header files? How to write your own?
+ pointer = Memory address of a RAM location

## Usecases
- get inputs from user? fgets()
- how to access memeory locations? using dereference operator &
