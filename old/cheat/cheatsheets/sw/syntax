# How to write your own syntax highlighting software?
Building a syntax highlighter is all about finding specific keywords in the code and giving them a specific
style (font, font style, colour etc.). In order to achieve this, you will need to define a list of keywords
specific to the programming language in which the code is written, and then parse the text
(e.g. using regular expressions), find the specific tokens and replace them with properly-styled HTML tags.

A very basic highligher written in JavaScript would look like this:

var keywords = [ "public", "class", "private", "static", "return", "void" ];
for (var i = 0; i < keywords.length; i++)
{
        var regex = new RegExp("([^A-z0-9])(" + keywords[i] + ")([^A-z0-9])(?![^<]*>|[^<>]*</)", "g");
        code = code.replace(regex, "$1<span class='rm-code-keyword'>$2</span>$3");
}

lexer vs parser difference    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2842809/lexers-vs-parsers

## Implementations
1. using lexer + parser, single pass
2. using other known tools and building a facade on top of it
