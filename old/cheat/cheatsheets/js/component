# Build an collapsable Accordion | Header then body | in 30 lines of code using design pattern
feature request: Can I choose my own state icons, expanded, collapsed
feature request: can you make it display body first then header? Or on left side or on right side?
  css changes: flexbox to css grids
  x: left={true}            dont make impossible states possible
  v: position="left"
feature request: expand, collapse individually and in bulk, all at once
  single={true}
  preventClose={true}       at least one should be expanded
!Props Explosion == APROPCALYPSE
  components with 30-60 props     increased bundle size
its easy when you have control over rendering
