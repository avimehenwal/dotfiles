# problems in graphics
- high resolution on a spehere. ffmpeg to decode
- buffer management, quiet a lot and put it where it meant to be
- writing appropriate shader in webGL or openGL
- compiling openGL code, linking to a specific vendor driver
- get the right packages and get them to talk to each other

# total real visualization
- audioGL
- webGL + openGL

- gemetry is the raw-data in a cs-ds
- vortex shader, which runs on every single point, material is also a shader + general transforms
- how match becomes pixel, abstractions like camera and lighting etc.
- this works so we are going with it is the motto of the graphics

- we love react data binding syntax so much

## three.js
rendere -> scene -> camera, light source -> data

react is a confluence of 3 things
1. syntax         -> JSX
2. semantics      -> lifecycle hooks
3. implementation -> reconciler
