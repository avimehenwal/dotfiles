# link previews | Open graph protocol | using pages meta-data
maybe difficult to do with client side rendering, only possible
1. when static pages are generated ahead of time
   - new pages CANNOT be built at runtime
2. for dynamic/unknown number of pages, SSR server side rendering, sites like medium, reddit
   + new pages CAN be built at runtime

<meta  property="og:site-name"  content="website name" />                 
<meta  property="og:image"      content="https://example.com/ogp.jpg" />                        
<meta  property="og:title"      content="some title for open graph" />
