next block depends on cryptographic hash of previous block
its a Data Structure

> Holy grail of transactions

# Block

- hash
- hash of previous block

# Why computational puzzle solving is important on blockchain? Bitcoin mining
Networking solving more computational power has the real say in consensus
Solves a cryptographic puzzles for nothing ==> Proof of work, reach CONSENSUS
