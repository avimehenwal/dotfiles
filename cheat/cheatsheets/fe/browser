# How do we change browser contents? => DOM How do I change DOM?
in memory tree DS representation of page
DOM API specification are different from browser and JS specification. you can have your own implementation
SHADOW DOM, enable from preferences to see shadown DOM, video tag controls, localized/scoped CSS changes. Decoupled from rest of the webpage
          el.createShadowRoot() then append contents to it.
          Encapsulation and isolation from normal DOM
          does webkit allocate memory each time for shadow DOM CSS? or is it shared?
          not a absolute black box, corruptable boundary when you choose to do that
