# building blocks of a webapp

- Robust: things will not fall apart when put to real load test
  - How? error handling, handing all possible paths to UI
    - handle both @client and @server side errors
  - use static types, always know the spapes of data
  - if there are errors then recover from errors, route validations
- route middlewares, AUTH middleware
- login and Identities IAM system as 3rd party service

## WebApp blocks

1. frontend presentation
2. backend api
3. backend data persistance
