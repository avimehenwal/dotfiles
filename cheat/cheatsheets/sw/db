# Database Relationship Modelling
1 to 1 Relationship
1 to Many Relationship | Many to 1 Relationship
Many to Many Relationship

## SQL vs NoSQL
+ Entire data is within same document, you see what you get
- Multiple copies of data, No single source of truth

SQL               NoSQL
Table oriented    json document oriented

## Functional Database, db is a software machine in itself 
- persistance
- other db things like consistency, reliability
- Computation (fiddeling with data) seperate from process (running the db machine)
> in FP, most of the data structures are persistent data-structure

# Database Questions
- Can DB support >300M records? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3779088/database-that-can-handle-500-millions-rows
- What are joins? How and when to write them? inner, outer, left, right
- diff b/w CHAR and VARCHAR2? fixed vs variable length
- What are KEYS? Primary,
- What are Constraints? Not Null, Check , Default, Unique, Primary Key, Foreign Key
- Data Integrity, accuracy of data
- How to display current data in SQL query? SELECT GETDATE();
- Explain Index? Unique, Clustered, Non-Clustered, special lookup tables
- Cursor Object, allows traversal on multiple records
- What happens if a foreign key referenced object is deleted? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54284084/how-are-foreign-keys-maintained-when-a-related-object-is-deleted
- What is GROUP BY? Aggregations on groups, like max(), min(), count()

# What is Normalization? and Denormalization
Insertion, update, deletion Anomaly
1NF deal with Atomicity, no repeating groups
2NF 1NF and no Partial Dependency
3NF no transitive dependency
3.5NF BCNF 
  
- Query Optimization
- DROP vs TRUNCATE
- ACID Transactions on DB
- Trigger stored procedures
- Queries and Sub-Queries
- What are VIEWS, virtual table +takes less space

# List the ways to get the count of records in a table?
SELECT * FROM table1
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1
SELECT rows FROM sysindexes WHERE id = OBJECT_ID(table1) AND indid < 2

# Write a SQL query to get the third-highest salary of an employee from employee_table?
SELECT TOP 1 salary
FROM(
  SELECT TOP 3 salary
  FROM employee_table
  ORDER BY salary DESC) AS emp
ORDER BY salary ASC;

# Between and IN
SELECT * FROM Students where ROLL_NO BETWEEN 10 AND 50;
SELECT * FROM students where ROLL_NO IN (8,15,25);

# How can you select unique records from a table?
Select DISTINCT studentID from Student

# How to create an index?
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name;
DROP INDEX index_name;
ALTER INDEX index_name on object_name;

# Named Foreign Key - referential integrity, Candidate
ALTER TABLE courses
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_CustomerCourse
FOREIGN KEY (customerID) REFERENCES Customers(customerID);

# JOIN
SELECT A.some B.thing
FROM Table_A AS A         # left table
FULL JOIN Table_B AS B    # right table
ON A.col = B.col;         # How the 2 tables are joined?

# How to model multi-step workflows in DB?
