# Database Relationship Modelling
1 to 1 Relationship
1 to Many Relationship | Many to 1 Relationship
Many to Many Relationship

## SQL vs NoSQL
+ Entire data is within same document, you see what you get
- Multiple copies of data, No single source of truth

SQL               NoSQL
Table oriented    json document oriented

## Functional Database, db is a software machine in itself 
- persistance
- other db things like consistency, reliability
- Computation (fiddeling with data) seperate from process (running the db machine)
> in FP, most of the data structures are persistent data-structure
