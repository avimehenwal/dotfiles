# Payment Processor
IOS 8583 standard   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8583
A payment processor is a company or financial institution that processes online transactions.
It is either a bank or a payment system, such as Visa, Mastercard, AmEx, etc. To integrate with a
processor, you need to obtain their API documentation and implement it as instructed. You will also
need to develop an external API for your clients. They will use it to send payments (one-time or recurring)
  for processing and receive the payment statuses back.
