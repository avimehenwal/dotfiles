# Where can I store images, video files? DB vs FS
Database (more expensive) << than *Filesystem
RDBMS can save longbinaryblob
you can super-accelerate file system access with standard off the shelf products
  for example, many web servers use the operating system's sendfile() system call
  to asynchronously send a file directly from the file system to the network interface.
  Images stored in a database don't benefit from this optimization.
static content serving from webserver like nginx requires no special coding. Store image paths in DB
challenge: maintian data integrity b/w database metadata about image and actual image on FS
- images on DB need no seperate backup policy, images on FS do
+ FS can stream images files asynchronously, RDBMS would need some code to implement it.
