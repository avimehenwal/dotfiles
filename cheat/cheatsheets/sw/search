## History
1999        Lucene search engine software library written in java
2004        Solr started java
2010        Solr merged with Lucene
Traditionally search operation is performed on SELECT * FROM TABLE, full table scans. No feasible for millions of records

## Search Systems
Based on Lucene Index system
Full text search techniques          all/selected portions of documents. Indexing and searching stages
Structured search
Queries, filters and caches
Faceted Search, stats, enumerations

## Search result operations
- search backend to sort the results
- Fuzzy search, rect (mispelled)
- Multiple words using and, else wont show
! search this and that?

## Use with web frontend
Downshift       WAI-ARIA compliant autocomplete
React.js        reactivity and web components
elastic-search  text search backend
apollo          graphQL server
caddy           HTTP2 enabled web server, proxy, load-balancing, http3. Nginx killer

## Elastic Search Features | google like search functionality
[ ] autocompletion
[ ] correcting typos
[ ] Highlighting Matches
[ ] Handling Synonyms
[ ] Adjusting relevance, ranking
[ ] Complex Analytics on Aggregated data + search terms

## Technology
Elastic search = { cluster of nodes (Multiple sharded Lucene Indexes) }
Shard = Lucene Index, Segments (mini indexes) -> inverted index key DS -> 

## elastic search server
/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
Determine INIT system on your linux         ps -p 1
application logs                            sudo journalctl --unit elasticsearch
http://localhost:9200/
Using `_create` guarantees that the document is only indexed if it does not already exist.
To update an existing document, you must use the `_doc` resource.

## indexing Images
Indexing a document containing image data is not much different from indexing any other document.
The API is the same, but the exception is that we want to put binary data in the image field.
Since JSON does not support binary data as a native value, the plugin expects the data to be base 64 encoded as a JSON string.
To distinguish these strings from normal strings, we also have to define the mappings explicitly for the image field.

## Managed elastic search in AWS

## Who uses ELK stack?
- tinder, NASA-JPL
- log analysis and log queries
- metrics and analytics
- documents are logical collection of index

# what is ElasticSearch? Search Engine software
- opensource analytics and full-text search engine (with caching))
- it is NOT a RDBMS, it is a document store, is a search and analytics engine to fine-tune search results based on precision, ranking and recall
- multiple shards on different nodes, on same node is an anti-pattern
- ES does not support joins and transasctions
- cannot I use RDBMS for searching? why handle the overhead of additional microservice?

# Elastic Search vs Business Intelligence Softwares

# User facing search engines
- search engine database written in rust  https://www.meilisearch.com/

## Meilisearch Engine
- opensource, ultrafast search engine database with REST API interface to power client search features
- 2010 ES and 2018, replacement for algolia and not ES, ES is very complex and highly scalable
- search index is document database with NO scshema
- sewarch even if there are mistakes in search text
- customizable search attributes on/off
