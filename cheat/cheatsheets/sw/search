# History
1999        Lucene search engine software library written in java
2004        Solr started java
2010        Solr merged with Lucene
Traditionally search operation is performed on SELECT * FROM TABLE, full table scans. No feasible for millions of records

# Search Systems
Based on Lucene Index system
Full text search techniques          all/selected portions of documents. Indexing and searching stages
Structured search
Queries, filters and caches
Faceted Search, stats, enumerations

# Search result operations
- search backend to sort the results
- Fuzzy search, rect (mispelled)
- Multiple words using and, else wont show
! search this and that?

# Use with web frontend
Downshift       WAI-ARIA compliant autocomplete
React.js        reactivity and web components
elastic-search  text search backend
apollo          graphQL server
caddy           HTTP2 enabled web server, proxy, load-balancing, http3. Nginx killer

# Elastic Search Features | google like search functionality
[ ] autocompletion
[ ] correcting typos
[ ] Highlighting Matches
[ ] Handling Synonyms
[ ] Adjusting relevance, ranking
[ ] Complex Analytics on Aggregated data + search terms

# Technology
Elastic search = { cluster of nodes (Multiple sharded Lucene Indexes) }
Shard = Lucene Index, Segments (mini indexes) -> inverted index key DS -> 

# elastic search server
/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
Determine INIT system on your linux         ps -p 1
application logs                            sudo journalctl --unit elasticsearch
http://localhost:9200/

# indexinf Images
Indexing a document containing image data is not much different from indexing any other document.
The API is the same, but the exception is that we want to put binary data in the image field.
Since JSON does not support binary data as a native value, the plugin expects the data to be base 64 encoded as a JSON string.
To distinguish these strings from normal strings, we also have to define the mappings explicitly for the image field.
