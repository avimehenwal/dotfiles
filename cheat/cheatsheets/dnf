# Package Groups
dnf group list

## Install a group
dnf group install "RPM Development Tools"

## Download source RPM
dnf download --source coreutils
yumdownloader --source redis

## List dependencies of a RPM package
dnf repoquery --requires redis    
dnf repoquery --depends redis

## how to install a source RPM?
rpm -vv -Uvh package.src.rpm
installed under $HOME/rpmbuild/SOURCES

The interest of installing a src.rpm is to modify and rebuild it.
But if the source you need already contains spec file to build the rpm
it's better downloading the source and building the rpm from it when you so desire:


## Difference b/w dnf and RPM?
These tools work together. DNF handles dependency solving, finding files on the network
repository management, and so on. RPM handles the lower-level part of actually putting the files on your system.
In most cases as an end user, DNF is all you need to interact with. You might use RPM commands for
lower-level troubleshooting, but in most cases DNF provides all the functionality in a more friendly manner.
Note that you may also see "Yum". DNF is the successor to that tool, which essentially did the same thing.
In recent versions of the Fedora OS, yum and dnf are exactly interchangeable.

## How to package a software

# list all installed kernels
dnf list installed kernels

# local install a rpm package, without going over to internet
yum --nogpgcheck localinstall packagename.arch.rpm
