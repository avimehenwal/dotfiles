loosing sense of reasoning, logic!
- being stunned and NOT able to include new information in reality
- not being able to summarize the information presented, so you are saying ... wrong summary
- trying to mind read the intent
- yelling and getting angry
- attacking someone's character instead of addressing their argument in light of loosing argument

# How to build Reppor? Break Cognitive dissonance?
crack a joke, get them to agree to something, light talk
- forget your past discontistencies
over estimating your talents, rating yourself better than you actually are, cognitive dissonance
