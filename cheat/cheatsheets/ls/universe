# Rebirth is due to unfulfilled karma/desire?
Energy (shakti) around Inert (no life/stone) -> Life/Creation, Revebrations -> matter -> atoms
- just energies around your vicinity can make life happen, byInduction
- This is 84th creation/112 cycles of creation, beyond that creation will be material free, The Matrix
Virus is just a combination of proteins, not a life until it finds a host

# What is Karma?
thoughts/emotions/feelings that passes through your brain are Karma, not only the physical actions
Karma builds and accumulates overtime and build into something big
