savour the taste of your triumphs today. Dont just swallow the moment whole without digesting what has actually happened
thankyou for your concerns, we will be watching you
when you invest in a seed and watching it grow without you is a bitter pill to swallow
Sometimes you need to get knocked down so you can really figure out what your fight is and how you need to fight it.
I wonder where it all started
