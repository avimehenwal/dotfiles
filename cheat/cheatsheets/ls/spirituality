# How to be conscious?
soul = pure consciousness, is getting bigger and bigger that the body can hardly contain it

- When you are happy and exuberant, you are open to changes
- Increase the level of energy, naturally transition to consciousness

> Only when you are pleasent, you are willing to change. Unplease, fixed like concrete/rock

Every moment of life should be used to either
1. enhance the profoundness of your life
2. or to creaete an impact in the world

# Why is it so difficult to dance with Life?
You can only use something once you know the nature of mind.
Eg: trying to lift a glass with hands 3 feet apart! You have wrong perception of glass,
thats why you cannot lift it.

if your mind punches you, we need to look at the nature of the mind.

EMOTION is the juice of life, train your thoughts and body

LOVE, extract something from someone or SHARE what you have with someone
You need partner to fulill needs, physical, social, cultural, financial

What is question? Question is just a tool to dig deeper!

# Swami Vivekananda
arise, awake from hypnotism of weakness, stand up, assert yourself and proclaim the god within you
each soul has divinity, goal is to manifest divinity within us.
realigion is not somthing to be talked about, but its something to be realized and lived upto
concern of my people, as long as even a dog remains hungry to feed and take care of him is my highest duty, anything else is non-religion/false religion
left his body when he was 39 years old

# HOw to interact with people
When you want someone to RECIEVE something, you have to tell them in a way THEY GET IT
