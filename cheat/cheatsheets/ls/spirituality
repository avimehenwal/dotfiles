You can only use something once you know the nature of mind.
Eg: trying to lift a glass with hands 3 feet apart! You have wrong perception of glass,

if your mind punches you, we need to look at the nature of the mind.

EMOTION is the juice of life, train your thoughts and body

You need partner to fulill needs, physical, social, cultural, financial
