systemd is an init system ; while supervisord is a process control system.
Though it seems that their function in similar, and they do share some goals; but supervisord is not meant as substitute of an init system.
(Your system wouldn't be able boot without an init system, PID 1 is the init process, it's the starting point of user-space)

init system is the standard interface, and I recommend using it rather than another process control applications like supervisor.

# diff b/w services and targets
man systemd.service
man systemd.target

# let systemd restart a process if it gets killed
Restart=always
Restart=on-failure
