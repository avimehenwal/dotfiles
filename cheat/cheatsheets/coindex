# Webapp not working on linux?
1. Server Side - npm dependencies 
- Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'child_process' in '/home/avi/WORK/webap
- Critical dependency: the request of a dependency is an expression
=> troubleshooting NPM package versions BY HAND
2. Client Side - console errors, doesnt render anything?
dont know what to do?
3. Docker volume mount on SELinux (security enabled)
  => use :z | :Z after volume mount and correct user and linux like folder permissions
