# Modules system implementations
1. AMD modules spec using requireJS implementation
2. commonJS modules used by nodejs
3. UMD Modules
4. ESModules spec built into modern ES6 language itself

# RequireJS
- Configure call
- Define calls - defines what js gets executed when you call it
- Require calls

# Require calls
require(['common'], function(){
    // load page/home only after common is loaded
    require(['page/home'], function(Y) {
        Y.doSomething();
      })
  })

- common.js would be the first file that gets loaded as soon as the require.js is done loading
- requirejs.config object has a property called paths, which is like shortcuts to load other libraries and provides free
fallback
- what define returns is captured by require
- requirejs has its own optimizer

# from browser console, how do I find out what all modules were loaded by requirejs on page?
