# Immutablility and FP in JS
How immutable data rocks, its just sits there like a rock

# Problems with mutability
- Track who is been changing what and when
- system might not be able to handle the mutation and break, bugs introduction
Eg: list of animals in zoo, someone puts an alien in list, now system breaks because it was expecting only earth animals!

copying is a waste of both time/space
do dances to the gods of time and complexity

# Immutable Data Structures | Persistant Data Structures (partially, full time-travel) git | Path Copying
how?  Trees and Sharing
Immutable data structures only carries most recent value
partially persistant DS keeps track of changes but allows you to work with only latest value
fully persistant DS keep track and well as all values in time, allows full time-travel

# TRIE | Bitmapped Vector Trie | Hash Array Mapped Trie
tree where leaves holds the values and paths represents the keys. Eg: search suggestions

# How to usse it?
