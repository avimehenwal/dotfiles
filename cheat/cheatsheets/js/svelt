# Why svelt
As programmer we should be offended by how inefficiently react works!
vDOM diffing is  very expensive and inefficient, bundle size matters
react should not be named as react

compilers are the new frameworks. Svelt is a compiler

# Reactive programming at frontend
if you do SSR with svelt your AWS bills will be low, tell your product managers that

browser has to compute 60 frames/sec. 60 hertz
style handling is built in to the framework
CSS animations runs off the main thread, hence CSS only alternatives are more performant and battery friendly
