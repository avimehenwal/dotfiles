# window. is implied with dom document object

document.getElementById('id') = window.document.getElementById('id')

A global variable, window, representing the window in which the script is running, is exposed to JavaScript code.

# DOM - Document Object Model

The DOM is an API that represents and interacts with any HTML or XML document. The DOM is a document model loaded in the browser and representing the document as a node tree, where each node represents part of the document (e.g. an element, text string, or comment).

The DOM is one of the most-used APIs on the Web because it allows code running in a browser to access and interact with every node in the document. Nodes can be created, moved and changed. Event listeners can be added to nodes and triggered on occurrence of a given event.

DOM was not originally specified—it came about when browsers began implementing JavaScript. This legacy DOM is sometimes called DOM 0. Today, the WHATWG maintains the DOM Living Standard.

## BUNDLERs

Dead code elimination, or Tree shaking, as it’s often called, is very important to achieve the optimum bundle size and hence app performance.
