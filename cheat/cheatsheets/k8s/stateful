# Stateful Application

- like databases, SQL or noSQL
- applications that stores data

## StafefulSet

can run Pods that uses storage configuration. Each replica pod will have same access to storage

> How to scale database application ?

Horizontal scaling without creating conflicts

- Losing data is unacceptable
- compute is seperated from persistance storage volume, DAL
- Ideally use a remote storage, as local volumes are tied to Cluster Node
- Ever Pod as a unique Identifier, sticky Identity

K8s is better suited for stateless applications rather than stateful application
K8s uses a Control Loop Mechanism
