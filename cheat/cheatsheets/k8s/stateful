# Stateful Application

- like databases, SQL or noSQL
- applications that stores data

## StafefulSet

can run Pods that uses storage configuration. Each replica pod will have same access to storage

- in stafeful sets Pods keeps the same Name and IP Address, when they get recreated

- Losing data is unacceptable
- compute is seperated from persistance storage volume, DAL
- Ideally use a remote storage, as local volumes are tied to Cluster Node
- Ever Pod as a unique Identifier, sticky Identity


CRD - Custome Resource Definitions
