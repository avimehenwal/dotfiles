Complex is the opposite of simple
complicated is more like the opposite of easy

The two are often related (with complex things being complicated and vice versa), but not always.

If something is complex, it means that its structure is not simple; it may be made up of many
parts and/or its component parts may be connected together in a non-trivial way.

If something is complicated, then it is difficult to use.

For example, a self-driving train will be very complex: it will have many systems on board to open
and close doors, control the temperature inside, detect obstacles, recognise stations and know when
to stop and start, and so on. But for people who ride it, it is not complicated: just wait for the
doors to open, get on, find a seat, then get off when it pulls into the right station.

Conversely, tamper-resistant clamshell packaging is fairly simple (often just two pieces of molded
plastic sealed together), but often complicated to open without damaging yourself and/or the contents.
