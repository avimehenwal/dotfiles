Difference b/w plugin and ftplugin directories?
  Whatever goes into plugin is loaded whenever vim starts whereas
  what you put in ftplugin is only loaded for the specific filetype it corresponds to 
 
What is after directory?
  In after you should put settings that you want to change from the normal plugin loading.

# list all loaded plugins
:scriptnames, :commands, :functions

# call functions on visual selection
