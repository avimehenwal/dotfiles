Most Ansible modules provide this idempotency
But some modules can be used in a way that breaks this pattern
we tell ansible how to do it

example of ansible module

```
- name: restart webserver
  service:
    name: httpd
    state: restarted
```

Wondering how Ansible works at a brick level. Most sites say a module is pushed and Ansible does not need an agent on the remote host - just SSH and Python.
It seems like Ansible would need to create a python script locally and copy it to the remote host. What is sent? Is it literally a .py file or a .pyc file - or other?
How is it possible the remote host will not need any additional Python packages?

https://serverfault.com/questions/931073/what-does-ansible-push-to-the-remote-host

- ansible stores python files in `$HOME/.ansible/tmp` directory
- `ANSIBLE_KEEP_REMOTE_FILES=1 ansible-playbook playbook.yml` to see what ansible sends over SSH

module `unarchive` Requires gtar/unzip command on target host. => host needs to be already provisioned with this package
so that ansible can configure it.

## Puppet vs Ansible
- puppet needs more componnets
- puppet agent software
  - puppet master software
- Puppet is a devil’s tool because
  - “It doesn’t allow me to make manual changes on the servers”, it will revert without asking
