Requires         specifies the dependencies needed to run the software. what do I need to install the package on system?
%prep            is used to create the environment for building the rpm package.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
%build           is used to compile and to build the source codes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
%install         this is used to install the programs. It lists command(s) to needed to copy the resultant file from the build process to the BUILDROOT directory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
%files           this section lists the files provided by the package, which will be installed on the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
%changelog       should stores the work on preparing the RPM, especially if there are security and bug patches included on top of the base upstream source. It’s automatically generated while creating the hello.spec file. The changelog data is usually displayed by rpm                                                                                                       changelog   q <packagename>.

install dependencies with spectool -g ./SPECS/python-dateutil.tzr.gz

## Build commands

rpmbuild -bp              run preperation only prep
rpmbuild -bc              short circuit, do not run full build
rpmbuild -bi              install, place files as on actual target
rpmbuild -bb              Build binary rpm
rpmbuild -bs              Build source rpm
rpmbuild -ba              Build both binary and source rpm

## Problems

- can only do one distro version at a time
  - use mock rpm package
  - too many BuildRequires might take forever
